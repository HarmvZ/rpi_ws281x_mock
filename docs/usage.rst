Usage
=====

Simply replace the pip installation command for `rpi_ws281x` with `rpi_ws281x_mock` in your development environment to start using it.

To use rpi-ws281x mock in a project::

    from rpi_ws281x import PixelStrip, Color

The naming is deliberately similar to the original library, so that you can use this library to fake the behavior without channging any of your code.
